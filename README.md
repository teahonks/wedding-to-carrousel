wedding-to-carrousel
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'wedding' with 'carrousel' (like from Logan's Run). Though I support panicsteve in his inclusion of articles, I don't think it's applicable here.

Forked right from [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt)

Packaged via [chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging)

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag WeddingToCarrousel.crx into the page that appears.
